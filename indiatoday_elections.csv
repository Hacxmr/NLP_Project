Down but not out: Is Nitish Kumar still the X-factor in Bihar Politics?,https://www.indiatoday.in/opinion/story/down-but-not-out-is-nitish-kumar-still-the-x-factor-in-bihar-politics-2705950-2025-04-08,"Political parties are already gearing up for the battle in Bihar due at the fag end of the year - heated barbs were exchanged between the Janata Dal (United)’s Nitish Kumar and the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Rabri Devi during the Budget session. Nitish Kumar wants to say goodbye in style - this likely being the last electoral battle of his career. The Lalu Prasad Yadav family, on the other hand, hopes 20 years of anti-incumbency will prove too hot to handle for a frail CM. Concerns over Nitish Kumar’s physical and mental fitness, the probable entry of his son Nishant into politics, Tejashwi Yadav’s claim that Nitish chacha’s days are numbered, the Congress party’s attempt to strengthen its organisational base under Krishna Allavaru, bold claims made by newbie Prashant Kishor, and the Bharatiya Janata Party central leadership’s dilemma over contesting the polls under Nitish Kumar’s leadership - all of this has made the contest very interesting.JD(U) commands crucial vote share The Samata Party, led by George Fernandes and Nitish Kumar, merged with Sharad Yadav’s JD(U) in 2003. Three years before that, both parties had contested in alliance with the BJP in undivided Bihar. The two parties together recorded a 15.2 per cent vote share, winning 55 seats. In 2005, the National Democratic Alliance won, ending 15 years of Lalu Prasad Yadav’s rule, with the JD(U) winning 88 seats and a 20.5 per cent vote share. In 2010, it almost touched a simple majority on its own, winning 115 seats (122 is the halfway mark) with a 22.6 per cent vote share. Nitish Kumar broke ranks with the BJP before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and contested the 2015 state elections in alliance with bete noire Lalu Yadav’s RJD. The two won a record mandate. The JD(U)’s seat tally, however, fell to 71, and its vote share dropped to 17.3 per cent. Nitish Kumar ended the alliance with the RJD in 2017, making a gharwapsi to the NDA. In 2020, the JD(U)’s tally slipped further to 43 seats as Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party rebelled, damaging its prospects in 28 seats. Its vote share fell to 15.7 per cent.A force multiplier Despite the JD(U)’s lacklustre performance and the Opposition’s claims that its leader is mentally unfit, Nitish Kumar, at 74, remains the central force in Bihar politics. He is the force multiplier - whichever party JD(U) aligns with goes on to form the government in the state.In 2015, Lalu Yadav aligned with Nitish Kumar, and the Mahagathbandhan formed the government. The RJD, which was routed in 2010, was given a lease of life by Nitish Kumar in many ways. The BJP-led NDA, which was touted to win the polls as per surveys, was humiliated.In the 2019 general elections, the BJP swept 39 of the 40 seats in Bihar after Nitish Kumar made a gharwapsi. In 2014, when the JD(U) contested alone, the BJP won 31 of the 40 seats. In the 2020 state elections, the BJP allied with the JD(U) again and won, bagging 125 of the 224 seats.Unique baseBihar's caste equations and societal conditions give Nitish Kumar the political manoeuvrability to switch sides successfully. A Kurmi by caste, he’s built a dedicated base of Mahadalits, Kurmis, Koeris, extremely backward classes, and religious minorities.He has exhibited the ability to transfer this vote seamlessly, irrespective of whether he is an ally of the NDA or Mahagathbandhan. This strategy has provided him the flexibility to align with whoever he wishes to remain on the throne. His core base has remained intact as he has devised specific schemes for Mahadalits and most backward classes.advertisementIn addition to this, Nitish Kumar enjoys popularity among women due to his schemes like free cycle distribution for school girls and his prohibition policy. In the recent Budget, too, he focused on this vote bank with numerous announcements like pink buses, pink toilets, mahila haat, etc. Women have recorded a higher turnout than men in Bihar for many elections now.He also brings a section of Pasmanda Muslim votes to the alliance due to his secular image. Of every 100 JD(U) voters, 20 are upper caste, 45 are non-Yadav OBCs (Kurmis, Koeris, extremely backward classes, etc), 10 are Yadav, 20 are Scheduled Caste, and five are Muslim.The JD(U) gets a leg up from upper caste and non-Yadav OBCs whenever it ties up with the BJP. It loses most of the upper caste support while contesting alone, like in the 2014 general elections, but holds on to a significant portion of the non-Yadav OBC vote. When contesting with the RJD, the composition of its support changes as it gets more Muslim and Yadav votes. It loses this while contesting alone, like in 2014, or when allying with the BJP, like in 2019.advertisementNitish, an X-factorExperts feel the BJP is the rising force in Bihar, and the JD(U) is now a spent force. They highlight the latter’s 2020 performance when it won just 43 seats, losing 28 seats compared to 2015. Meanwhile, the BJP won 74 seats, gaining 21. The JD(U) could have won 71 seats had the LJP not rebelled from the NDA and curiously propped candidates only against the JD(U) while sparing the BJP.Rumour has it that this was part of a conscious strategy by the BJP to weaken the JD(U) and emerge as the bigger brother of the alliance. Further, a post-poll study by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies shows only 55 per cent of traditional BJP supporters voted for JD(U) candidates, while 75 per cent of JD(U) supporters voted for the BJP in seats contested by both parties.Just before the 2024 general elections, Nitish Kumar shifted from the INDIA bloc to the NDA, helping the alliance win 30 of the 40 seats in Bihar. This, in the end, proved very crucial as the BJP fell short of a simple majority in the Lok Sabha polls. An ostensibly weaker JD(U) won 12 of the 16 seats with an 18.9 per cent vote share. The BJP won 12 seats with a 21 per cent vote share as it contested only 17 seats.advertisementNitish Kumar has naturally lost some popularity, suffering from anti-incumbency. Tejashwi Yadav leads the CM race with 41 per cent ratings, while Nitish Kumar is trailing at 18 per cent, as per a CVoter survey.

Sources said the Congress, which contested a lesser number of seats than the RJD in the 2020 polls, was not willing to compromise this time and is keen on getting an equal number or more seats. Interestingly, in the 2020 polls, the RJD-Congress-Left alliance fell short of securing a simple majority by just 12 seats. This even as the RJD emerged as the single-largest party in the 243-member Assembly with 75 seats. It was the Congress that dragged down the alliance, winning only 19 of the 70 seats allocated to it. While the RJD secured 75 of the 144 seats, the CPI(ML) won 12 of its 19 seats.Published By:Abhishek DePublished On:Apr 17, 2025Must Watch","Tejashwi Yadav was the chief ministerial candidate in 2020, and he will be the face for CM in 2025 as well.

"Is Kanhaiya Kumar stealing Tejashwi Yadav's thunder on jobs, migration in Bihar?",https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kanhaiya-kumar-job-push-padyatra-tejashwi-yadav-unemployment-issue-bihar-polls-congress-rjd-2705912-2025-04-08,"As Bihar heads towards a crucial assembly election, the Congress is making a renewed pitch for the youth vote. At the heart of this effort is Kanhaiya Kumar’s “Palayan Roko, Naukri Do” (stop migration, provide jobs) padyatra, aimed at spotlighting rampant unemployment and migration in the state. What makes this political move significant is its overlap with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s core campaign agenda. Since the 2020 assembly elections, Tejashwi has made unemployment, migration, and education his central plank. Now, with Congress raising the same issues, questions are being asked: Is Kanhaiya Kumar trying to take over Tejashwi’s narrative? And could this cause friction within the Mahagathbandhan alliance? Tensions came into sharper focus when Congress MP Rahul Gandhi joined Kanhaiya’s padyatra in Begusarai on Monday. The optics made it clear—Congress is eyeing the youth vote with intent and could be looking to reposition itself as the primary voice on employment.TEJASHWI’S 10-LAKH JOBS PITCH In 2020, Tejashwi had promised 10 lakh government jobs if his party was voted to power. This prompted the BJP to counter with a promise of 20 lakh jobs and self-employment opportunities. The issue of unemployment has since stayed central to Bihar’s politics. In its recent budget, the Bihar government continued to focus on youth welfare, announcing plans to create 12 lakh government jobs and over 34 lakh self-employment opportunities.DIFFERENT STYLES, SAME AUDIENCE Despite being allies on paper, Tejashwi and Kanhaiya are starkly different in style and background. Kanhaiya, a former JNU Students’ Union president and known for his powerful speeches, entered Bihar politics with a bang during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. However, his candidature from Begusarai on a CPI ticket was reportedly opposed by RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, who saw him as a potential threat to Tejashwi's political rise. Back then, the CPI's insistence on fielding Kanhaiya from Begusarai led to a breakdown in seat-sharing talks with RJD. Kanhaiya eventually lost to BJP’s Giriraj Singh. Now with the Congress, Kanhaiya was once again expected to contest from Begusarai in 2024. But the seat went to the CPI, prompting his supporters to blame Lalu and Tejashwi for blocking his ticket.WHOSE AGENDA IS IT ANYWAY? Kanhaiya’s padyatra, which began on March 16 in Champaran and ends on April 11 in Patna, is set to culminate with a planned “gherao” of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s residence. The focus is squarely on jobs and migration. But the bigger question remains—has Kanhaiya managed to hijack Tejashwi’s key issues, or is he simply reinforcing the Mahagathbandhan's shared goals?Published By:Anuja JhaPublished On:Apr 8, 2025Must Watch","As Bihar heads towards a crucial assembly election, the Congress is making a renewed pitch for the youth vote.

Chirag Paswan's Bihar bid: Pressure tactic on BJP or strategy to replace Nitish?,https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/assembly/story/chirag-paswan-bihar-assembly-election-pressure-tactic-on-bjp-or-strategy-to-replace-nitish-kumar-2734446-2025-06-02,"The Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) advocating for its party chief, Chirag Paswan, to contest the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar and that too, from a general seat, has triggered speculation about whether the 42-year-old Union Minister is set to throw his hat into the ring for the chief minister's post. On Sunday, Paswan's brother-in-law and MP Arun Bharti created a flutter with a series of social media posts, saying party workers wanted the minister to contest the state election not from a reserved seat but a general seat in order to send a strong message that he was not just a leader of the Dalit community but was now ready to lead the state. Interestingly, the entire buzz started when Paswan, currently Union Minister for Food Processing Industries, expressed his desire to return to Bihar to focus on state politics instead of staying in Delhi. Speaking about the buzz, the Union Minister said, “I have said this previously, that I don’t see myself in National politics for long. The only reason I came into politics was Bihar and Biharis. My vision has always been ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’, and I always want Bihar to prosper and be at par with other developed states."" He added, ""And I realised after becoming an MP for the third time that this would not be possible in Delhi. I had expressed my wish before the party that I want to return to Bihar soon.""CHIRAG IN RACE FOR CM? Chirag Paswan is a three-time Member of Parliament and currently a Union Minister in the Modi government. He was elected MP from Jamui (SC) in 2014 and 2019, and from Hajipur (SC) in 2024. Despite being inducted into the Union Cabinet in 2024 for the first time, Paswan has shown reluctance to continue at the Centre and is now keen on making a return to state politics. His party pushing the narrative that he should contest the assembly elections and lead the state strongly indicates he is eyeing the Chief Minister’s post. It’s worth noting that the NDA has already declared that the upcoming Bihar elections will be fought under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, despite his waning popularity and reports of his deteriorating health. Paswan, if sources are to be believed, is looking to capitalise on the present political vacuum. The Union Minister, however, was categorically said that Nitish Kumar will not be replaced. ""There is no vacancy for the chief minister post in Bihar. Nitish Kumar will become the CM after the elections,"" he said.PRESSURE TACTICS ON BJP? The other theory in the political circles of Bihar regarding Chirag's return to state politics is that he is trying to build pressure on the BJP for a seat-sharing agreement in the NDA. Chirag showcased his political strength during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections when his party, with the 100% strike rate, won all the five seats it contested. In the last couple of years, Chirag has been continuously doing public meetings across the state with his ""Bihar First, Bihari First"" agenda and drawing a huge response from the public. This clearly went on to show that Chirag was the tallest Dalit face in the state presently and had a solid vote base of at least 6% in the Dalit community, especially the Paswan community. Perhaps, this is one of the main reasons behind Chirag's uncompromising view on the seat-sharing agreement, where it wants the bigger share of the pie. LJP(R) building pressure on the BJP may not augur well for the NDA as the saffron party has already declared Nitish Kumar as the CM face and Chirag's fresh political manoeuvering could pose a serious challenge ahead of it to keep the NDA intact without upsetting anyone. Remember, the seat-sharing formula in the NDA for the Bihar elections has still not been finalised. However, continuous discussions within the alliance partners are going on.CHIRAG AS NITISH'S REPLACEMENT? Another narrative that is a point of discussion in Bihar politics is whether BJP is trying to position Chirag as an alternative to Nitish Kumar if NDA wins the elections. Keeping in mind Nitish Kumar's deteriorating health, popularity and influence, was the BJP looking for an alternative to Nitish Kumar? In the 2020 assembly elections, LJP(R) walked out of the NDA after Chirag's party failed to get the desired number of seats in the seat-sharing agreement and contested elections on its own, fielding more than 130 candidates, all against JDU, leading to a terrible performance by Nitish Kumar's party where it was pushed to third spot with just 43 seats. It was alleged then that it was the BJP's brain child behind Chirag walking out of NDA and fielding candidates against JDU to damage the party in which it was successful. It was after the 2020 assembly elections that a role reversal took place and the BJP emerged as a bigger partner in the NDA. If the NDA wins and Nitish becomes CM again, but is unable to perform due to health concerns, Chirag could step in as a ready and acceptable replacement.Published By:Priya PareekPublished On:Jun 2, 2025","The Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) advocating for its party chief, Chirag Paswan, to contest the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar.

Masterstroke or damage-control? BJP's caste census sets ball rolling in Bihar,https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/assembly/story/caste-census-centre-bihar-assembly-polls-modi-bjp-nitish-kumar-lalu-yadav-rjd-2718122-2025-05-01,"In a politically significant decision ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government has announced thatcaste enumeration will be conducted alongside the upcoming decennial national census. The move is widely interpreted as a calibrated attempt to counter the opposition INDIA bloc's growing demand for a nationwide caste census — an issue that has gained traction in Bihar's deeply caste-sensitive political landscape. The announcement comes amidst speculation that theBJP is seeking to pre-empt a possible division of Hindu votesalong caste lines, which could undermine its electoral prospects in a state where identity politics has historically overshadowed religious consolidation. Bihar had already conducted a state-level caste survey in 2023 under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led thenMahagathbandhangovernment, which included the Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and the Congress. The survey’s findings were made public on October 2, 2023. At the time, the decision to undertake the survey had received unanimous support from all parties in the state, including the BJP, which was in the opposition. Yet, demands for a nationwide enumeration persisted, with both Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his then-deputy Tejashwi Yadav pressing the Centre to take up the issue. Ironically, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, during recent visits to Bihar,criticised the state-conducted surveyand called for a fresh national caste census — despite his party being part of the government that carried out the 2023 exercise. Political analysts view the Centre's decision as both atactical masterstroke and a damage-control measure. ""The BJP has failed to project a strong Hindutva figure like Yogi Adityanath in Bihar and has had to engage with the region’s entrenched caste arithmetic,"" said Abhay Mohan Jha, a Patna-based political commentator. By embracing caste enumeration, the BJP appeared to be adapting to the ground realities of Bihar's politics, where electoral outcomes have long been shaped more by caste coalitions than communal mobilisation. Analysts suggested that the saffron party is aiming toneutralise one of theMahagathbandhan'scentral campaign planks, while simultaneously retaining key allies at the Centre, inlcluding Nitish Kumar and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan.THE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT The BJP's move also appeared to be shaped by past electoral setbacks. In the 2015 Bihar elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav had successfully turned the tide in his favour after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat suggested a review of the reservation policy — fuelling fears among OBCs, SCs, and STs of a rollback in affirmative action. Caste is still the cornerstone of electoral strategy in Bihar, with the RJD banking on its traditional Yadav-Muslim base, and the Janata Dal (United) leaning on support from Kurmis, Koeris, OBCs, and Mahadalits. ""Our demand for caste census is longstanding. It will provide accurate data for planning and ensure the development of marginalised communities,"" Nitish Kumar said in response to the Centre's recent announcement. Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary echoed the sentiment from the BJP's side, stating, ""The caste census will enable better socio-economic planning for deprived sections of society"".OPPOSITION'S 'IDEOLOGICAL VICTORY' RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav hailed the move as a belated acknowledgement of socialist politics. ""The first caste survey was done in Bihar under our 17-monthMahagathbandhangovernment. The issues we raised three decades ago are now setting the national agenda. We'll continue to make these Sanghis dance to our tune,"" he said. Even Rahul Gandhi welcomed the government's 'sudden' decision to include caste enumeration in the forthcoming census after ""11 years of opposing it"". He also credited Congress's sustained campaign and said that it was the pressure put by the grand old party on the government for the caste census has worked. ""It doesn't matter what the BJP thinks. We have shown that we can pressure the BJP into doing the caste census,"" Gandhi said at a press conference. ""We wholeheartedly welcome this decision but demand a clear implementation timeline,"" the Gandhi scion said.Published By:Sahil SinhaPublished On:May 1, 2025Must Watch",The move is widely interpreted as a calibrated attempt to counter the opposition INDIA bloc's growing demand for a nationwide caste census.
