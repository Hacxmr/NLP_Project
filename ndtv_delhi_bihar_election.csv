"""Governance Is Not Theatrics"": PM's Dig At AAP After BJP Wins Delhi",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/delhi-election-result-live-theres-satisfaction-over-freeing-delhi-from-aapda-pm-modi-7665102#pfrom=home-ndtvelex_live_day_watch_live_elections,"Delhi Assembly Election Result 2025: Delhi, PM Narendra Modi said, can now look forward. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing BJP workers after the party's stupendous victory in Delhi, said it was a victory of ""development, vision and trust (Vikas, Vision Vishwas)"". TheDelhi Assembly Election 2025, that sent Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party packing after more than a decade, also proved that the people of Delhi would not tolerate ""corruption, and lies in politics... they want governance, not theatrics,"" he added in one of the many jibes at the outgoing AAP. The BJP is storming back to power in Delhiafter nearly three decades, winning close to 50 of Delhi's 70 seats, while AAP - which won 60-plus seats in the last two elections --lags behind with 20-plus seats. Seen as the architect of this historic victory, PM Modi heaped insults on AAP and the Congress. ""The party which was born out of a movement against corruption, found themselves getting drowned in corruption... Their Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister and ministers went to jail. Liquor scam, school scam was a disgrace to Delhi's image and they were arrogant about it. When Delhi was suffering from Covid, they were building Sheesh Mahal. In first Vidhan Sabha session of Delhi, CAG report will be presented in the house and this is Modi's guarantee,"" he said. Harsher words were reserved for the Congress. ""India's oldest party has not managed to open their account in six elections in Delhi (Lok Sabha and assembly). I told you Congress is a parasite party they takes the other party down with them whenever they are drowning. Their method is also unique, they steal their agendas and then target their vote bank and steal their votes,"" he said. ""Those holding Congress's hand are getting destroyed because it is not the same Congress as it was before independence and few years after 1947. They are doing Urban Naxal politics. Their politics is focussed on bringing anarchy and AAP-da was trying to do the same thing,"" he said. Delhi, he added, can now look forward, having rejected the politics of ""corruption"" and ""idiocy"" --""It is my guarantee to the people of Delhi - Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas and puri Dilli ka Vikaas"". The BJP, he said, has left a clear footprint in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and recently, Maharashtra and Haryana opted for the party with good reason, he said, ""The law-and-order situation in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh once caused problems, but we worked to fix it. In Maharashtra, farmers suffered from drought, so we created Jalyukt Shivir to help them,"" he said. With two NCR states - Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - already under the BJP belt, he said the victory in Delhi will help ensure better governance in the region. The double engine government will now ensure that all the party's election promises are kept. This would include clearing up the city, tackling pollution, garbage and sewage problems. Along with this, he promised that the Yamuna river - which was catapulted into becoming an election issue after Mr Kejriwal's allegation that Haryana is poisoning its waters - will become the ""identity (pehchaan)"" of the national capital. The promises made to women will also be kept, he said. The victory speech of the Prime Minister also carried a bow to allies. ""Bihar was in a poor state and change came when NDA government came to power. Similarly in Andhra, Chandrababu Naidu has shown his track record. NDA means a guarantee for development, good governance. It benefits not just the poor but also the middle class. The middle class has supported the BJP. People from different professions are working with BJP and because of this, we have always prioritised the middle class,"" he said.

He has warned that the Arvind Kejriwal-led party would struggle to hold on to Punjab as it has ""lost the morality of revolution"". Mr Ashutosh, once a close aide of Mr Kejriwal, said in a post on X that AAP was ""finished"" when party leaders ""started taking chartered flights, staying in presidential suits and building 'Sheesh Mahals' for themselves"". The 'Sheesh Mahal' remark was aimed directly at Mr Kejriwal, who the BJP has accused of massive corruption in revamping the Chief Minister's residence during his term in office. A veteran journalist, Mr Ashutosh was among the leaders of the India Against Corruption movement who later decided to float a political outfit. Mr Ashutosh contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls but lost to BJP's Harsh Vardhan. He quit AAP in 2018, citing personal reasons. In his post on X, he also flagged AAP leaders' enjoying Z+ security cover and intimidating mediapersons. He also pointed to the AAP's pre-poll allegations that Haryana has poisoned water coming to Delhi. AAP, he said, suffered defeat because it lost its morality. ""AAP became an election-fighting party. It stuck to the chair. AAP's asset was its morality. When that was lost, the government was lost too. It would be difficult to save Punjab too,"" he said. After a decade-long rule in the national capital, AAP suffered a crushing defeat in this Delhi election. While the BJP scored 48 seats, AAP managed 22 -- 40 less than the 2020 election. What added to the damage was the defeat of AAP's top guns, including Mr Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Satyendra Jain. Earlier, AAP's now-expelled co-founder Prashant Bhushan held Mr Kejriwal responsible for the Delhi poll debacle. In a post on X, Mr Bhushan accused Mr Kejriwal of changing the nature of AAP after it was founded as a transparent platform for alternative politics. Targeting Mr Kejriwal, he said, ""He built a 45 cr sheesh mahal for himself & began travelling in luxury cars. He binned 33 detailed Policy reports of expert committees set up by AAP, saying that the party will adopt expedient policies when the time comes."" ""He (Kejriwal) felt that politics could be done by bluster and propaganda. This is the beginning of the end of AAP,"" Mr Bhushan added.

Mr Kejriwal finished around 1,200 votes behind his rival, with the Congress' Sandeep Dikshit third. It comes as a huge loss for the AAP leader as he held the seat since 2013 when he beat Congress stalwart and then Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit. Manish Sisodia, who is the senior-most leader of AAP after Mr Kejriwal, conceded defeat from the Jangpura seat. ""Party workers fought well; we all did hard work. People have supported us as well. But, I lost by 600 votes. I congratulate the candidate who won. I hope he will work for the constituency,"" he said. Mr Sisodia was credited with the overhaul of Delhi's government schools in the first term of the AAP government. However, during his second term, Mr Sisodia was arrested amid allegations of corruption in Delhi's now-scrapped liquor policy. Shortly after his arrest in February 2023, Mr Sisodia resigned as deputy Chief Minister. This election, the biggest challenge the AAP government faced was the Delhi liquor policy case. While AAP failed to win the assembly election, Delhi Chief MinisterAtishimanaged to retain south Delhi's Kalkaji seat.

A woman, Rekha Gupta, becoming the new chief minister of the national capital was a matter of pride, he told reporters on Friday, adding that the people voted for her because of her ""pure thoughts and deeds"". As chief minister, Mr Kejriwal should have set an example before society but went astray, said Mr Hazare whose anti-corruption movement is credited for the birth of the Aam Aadmi Party. ""The earlier CM (Kejriwal) was doing a good job and became Delhi chief minister thrice. I did not speak anything (against him) as he was doing a good job. But then, he slowly started opening liquor vends and issuing licences. Then I got upset,"" Mr Hazare told reporters, referring to the AAP government's controversial excise policy. Mr Hazare, notably, is known for a staunch opposition to the consumption or sale of liquor. Mr Kejriwal was once Mr Hazare's associate in the anti-corruption movement, but the two parted ways after the former formed the AAP in 2012. In the elections earlier this month, the BJP ousted the AAP from power in Delhi, with Kejriwal losing his seat. The Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate have alleged that irregularities had been committed while modifying the Delhi excise policy 2021-22 and undue favours extended to licence holders.

Another senior Bengal BJP leader, Sukanta Majumdar, served up a similar warning, declaring, ""People of Bengal will also vote for the BJP... in the next Assembly election..."" Both also thanked the Bengali community in Delhi for the BJP's win, although it is unclear (at this time) if they voted for the saffron party or for Aam Aadmi Party, which was backed by Ms Banerjee. #WATCH|#DelhiElectionResults| West Bengal LoP and BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari says, ""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai...2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai...""pic.twitter.com/fVVzS2Ypqj The BJP has routed the AAP in Delhi, winning 48 of 70 Assembly seats, a dramatic improvement from the eight it won in the 2020 election and three in the 2015. Defeat for the AAP today was compounded by party boss Arvind Kejriwal and his aide, Manish Sisodia, losing their individual contests. READ |Arvind Kejriwal Loses New Delhi Seat As AAP Is Routed The Bengal BJP leaders' warnings come ahead of the Bengal election in March-April next year and underlines the BJP's determination to break Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress, which has, over the past decade, been a thorn in the side of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP. Ms Banerjee has led the Trinamool to victory over Prime Minister Modi and the BJP in three consecutive major elections - the 2019 and 2024 Lok Sabha polls, and the 2021 Bengal election. The Trinamool also registered a near-clean sweep BJP in the 2021 Kolkata local body polls. In the 2019 federal election, the Trinamool eked out a four-seat win over the BJP. Five years later she flexed her political muscles and left the saffron party further behind, winning 29 seats to open a 17-seat margin. In between, the BJP was thumped in the 2021 state election for good measure. But each win was followed by fierce squabbling between the two parties, with allegations of orchestrating post-poll violence - gunfights, mob killings, and crude bomb attacks that killed party workers and supporters from both sides - and adding to the bad blood. That enmity increased as the two went head-to-head over controversies to have hit Ms Banerjee's government, including the rape and murder of a young doctor at Kolkata'sRG Kar Hospitalin August last year and claims of sexual assault inSandeshkhaliby local Trinamool leader Sheikh Shahjahan. Much of the BJP's recent attacks on Ms Banerjee have been led by Mr Adhikari, who was the Chief Minister's confidante before his shock switch in December 2020, weeks before the last state poll. READ |In Sandeshkhali, Suvendu Adhikari's ""Revenge"" Warning To Mamata On the Sandeshkhali scandal, for example, last month Mr Adhikari said, ""... the BJP will send you to jail for making these women go to jail in false cases. We will take revenge, with interest."" The jabs at Ms Banerjee are also significant because the Trinamool had backed the AAP - in a move that raised tension within the INDIA bloc after it and the Congress failed to agree seat-share deal. That wound up, potentially, allowing the BJP to canter to victory after the AAP lost multiple seats due to Congress candidates splitting votes. NDTV Explains |How AAP-Congress Feud Split Opposition Votes In Delhi Poll However, formed to defeat the BJP in state and central elections, the INDIA grouping has stuttered and flattered to impress since it was formed in June 2023.

How AAP-Congress Feud Split Opposition Votes,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/delhi-election-results-2025-did-congress-hurt-aap-in-delhi-11-seats-tell-a-tale-7664856#pfrom=home-ndtvelex_live_day_watch_live_elections,"As the BJP scored a massive win in Delhi, ending the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) 10-year rule in Delhi, a key question is doing the rounds. Did the Congress's solo show in Delhi hurt AAP's prospects, dividing the Opposition votes and making the road to victory easier for the BJP? According to the Election Commission data, AAP got 43 per cent of the vote share, while the BJP cornered 45 per cent. The Congress got 6 per cent of the vote share but won zero seats. So, an AAP-Congress alliance could have kept the BJP in the Opposition. However, local rivalries and both parties' reluctance to reach an agreement ruled out this possibility. Also, the AAP-Congress alliance during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls did not yield good results for the Opposition and BJP won all seven Delhi seats. While the AAP has accused the Congress of speaking in the same language as the BJP, the Congress has said it was not its responsibility to ensure AAP's win. It must, however, be kept in mind that even with the 11 seats AAP lost to a split in Opposition votes, the ruling party would have fallen short of the majority mark. So while the Congress candidates hurt AAP's prospects, the BJP clearly outperformed it in the capital fight. NDTV looks at 11 key seats where top AAP leaders lost to the BJP by slim margins while the Congress cornered a significant chunk of votes. New Delhi:AAP's national convener Arvind Kejriwal lost to the BJP's Parvesh Verma in the New Delhi constituency. The margin was 4,089 votes. Congress's Sandeep Dikshit, former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit's son, got 4,568 votes and finished a distant third. So, if the AAP and the Congress had contested this election together, Mr Kejriwal would have likely scored a slim victory. Jangpura:Former Deputy Chief Minister and AAP Number 2 Manish Sisodia lost to BJP's Tarvinder Singh Marwah by a thin margin of 675 votes. Look at the candidate list and you find Congress's Farhad Suri, who got 7,350 votes. An alliance would have likely transferred these votes to Mr Sisodia and ensured his comfortable victory. Greater Kailash:Greater Kailash in south Delhi was being seen as a safe seat for the AAP and many had hoped three-time MLA and minister Saurabh Bharadwaj would win comfortably. But the BJP's Shikha Roy defeated Mr Bharadwaj by a margin of 3,188 votes. The Congress's Garvit Singhvi won 6,711 votes and if there was an alliance, it is possible that Mr Bharadwaj won the seat. Malviya Nagar:A similar story unfolded in Malviya Nagar, where BJP's Satish Upadhyay defeated three-time MLA Somnath Bharti by a margin of 2,131 votes. The Congress's Jitender Kumar Kochar got 6,770 votes, effectively ruining the game for the AAP candidate. Badli:In Badli, BJP's Aahir Deepal Chaudharyy defeated AAP's Ajesh Yadav by 15,163 votes. The Congress Devender Yadav won 41,071 votes. If there had been an alliance, AAP could have had a smooth sail. Timarpur:BJP's Surya Prakash Khatri won Timarpur by a slim margin of 1,168 votes, defeating the BJP's Surinder Pal Singh. The Congress Lokendra Kalyan Singh won 8,361 votes and this worked to the BJP's advantage. Nangloi Jat:The BJP's Manoj Kumar Shokeen won the seat by a margin of 26,251 votes, defeating the AAP's Raghuvinder Shokeen. The Congress's Rohit Choudhary got 32,028 votes and ate into the Opposition votes that would have otherwise gone to AAP. Rajinder Nagar:Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak lost to the BJP's Umang Bajaj by a margin of 1,231 votes. Vineet Yadav of the Congress, who got 4,105 votes, worked to the AAP's disadvantage. Chhatarpur:In south Delhi's Chhatarpur, BJP's Kartar Singh Tanwar defeated the AAP's Brahm Singh Tanwar by a margin of 6,239 votes. The Congres's Rajender Singh Tanwar got 6,601 votes, more than the margin of defeat. This worked to the BJP's advantage. Sangam Vihar:BJP's Chandan Kumar Choudhary won the election by the thinnest margin across the capital, defeating AAP's Dinesh Mohaniya by just 344 votes. In the same seat, Congress's Harsh Choudhary got 15,863 votes and spoiled the AAP's game. Trilokpuri:The east Delhi seat saw BJP's Ravi Kant winning by a margin of just 392 seats. AAP's Anjana Parcha lost to the BJP and the Congress's Amardeep, who won 6,147 votes, clearly split the Opposition votes.

AAP vs Congress In Punjab Over '30 MLAs In Touch With Us' Claim,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/aap-vs-congress-in-punjab-over-30-mlas-in-touch-with-us-claim-after-delhi-assembly-election-loss-7683098,"AAP MP from Punjab Malvinder Singh Kang hit out at Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa on Monday for claiming that 30 MLAs of the state's ruling party were in touch with him, saying even his party's legislators were not with him. Following the Aam Aadmi Party's loss in the Delhi Assembly polls, Bajwa had claimed that an internal power struggle would ensue between Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and party supremo Arvind Kejriwal. The Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly had also claimed that more than 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with the Congress and ready to switch sides. Hitting back, Kang, the MP from Anandpur Sahib and AAP's chief spokesperson in Punjab, said, ""Are all Congress MLAs in touch with you? If they are, where is Sandeep Jakhar (suspended Abohar MLA)? Why did Raj Kumar Chabbewal leave the party?"" Chabbewal, who is now an AAP MP, had switched over from the Congress last year. Kang said Bajwa's own brother, Fatehjang Bajwa, joined the BJP and he could not stop him. ""Meanwhile, Congress leaders, MLAs and former legislators are continuously leaving the party. Yet Bajwa seems worried about AAP MLAs,"" he said in a statement. Bajwa is known for making ""baseless statements"" and his claims never turn out to be true, Kang alleged, adding the Congress was in such a situation that despite winning zero seats in Delhi, their leaders were celebrating over the BJP's victory. Asked about Kejriwal's meeting with Mann and party MLAs in Delhi on Tuesday, Kang said it is an organizational meeting. ""Arvind Kejriwal is the national convenor of our party. Such meetings are a regular part of any party's internal processes,"" he said. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

"Congress-AAP's Unity Strongly Needed, Should Have Fought Delhi Polls Together: Amartya Sen",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/congress-aap-unity-strongly-needed-should-have-fought-delhi-elections-2025-together-amartya-sen-7693982,"Advocating a ""strong need"" for unity between the Congress and the Aam Admi Party (AAP), Nobel laureate Professor Amartya Sen said that the two parties should have fought the Delhi elections together with mutually agreed commitments. Speaking to PTI during an exclusive interview at his ancestral home here in West Bengal's Birbhum district, Sen also said that if secularism in India were to survive, there would not only have to be unity but also agreement on things that had made India an excellent example of pluralism. ""I don't think the result of the Delhi elections should be exaggerated, but it certainly has its significance. And if the AAP had won there, that victory would have carried its own weight,"" Sen told PTI. Delving deeper into the reasons behind AAP's setback, the eminent economist said that one factor is the ""lack of unity among those who did not want a Hindutva-oriented government in Delhi"". ""If you look at the numbers in many seats, the margin of BJP's advantage over the AAP was less, sometimes far less, than the votes that the Congress received,"" he said. According to him, another important question is clarity with respect to policy. ""What were the AAP's commitments? I don't think the AAP succeeded in making clear that it was firmly secular and for all Indians. There was too much catering to Hindutva. So it's not even clear how committed it was against religious communalism. The AAP didn't take clear sides on that,"" the Nobel laureate claimed. The nonagenarian, however, praised the AAP for its efforts on school education and healthcare and suggested that the Congress should have joined the party on those issues. ""I have a daughter living in Delhi, and she and her family praise the AAP's efforts in the spheres of school education and healthcare. The Congress could have come together with the AAP, saying, 'we like their schools, we like their hospitals, we want to extend them, and go beyond'. That would have been a better line than the one it took,"" he said. ""The lack of focus of the opposition parties on public services in Delhi made it possible for the eventual electoral victors to focus instead on liquor licences and tax laws. AAP leaders were even held in custody, awaiting trial,"" he added. Sen said that the AAP could have focused more on issues of secularism as well as health care and education for all and could have done more to try and join hands with Congress on these. ""Instead they were on different sides,"" Sen said. ""The fact is that this is a war that the AAP with the INDIA coalition need not have lost. But they did,"" he said. Asked whether there could be any impact of the result of the Delhi elections on Indian politics, the economist said that parties should be clear on where they stand and why. ""Yes, indeed. I think the big impact may be on elections in Uttar Pradesh,"" said Sen. ""The lesson to learn from the AAP's poll debacle is to reinforce to a great extent what the Samajwadi Party did at the time of the general election, namely, to take a clear stand against Hindutva politics. Most Indians don't want a Hindu Rashtra,"" he stressed. He hoped that ""the Delhi election results would have the effect of emphasising the need for unity of vision."" Talking about whether the results of the Delhi polls could have any impact on the Assembly elections in Bengal next year, Sen said every election in India has an impact on others and there could possibly be an effect. ""In Bengal, even though secular parties like the Trinamool Congress, the CPI(M) and the Congress have gone separate ways, there is still something of a social consensus on the importance of secularism, and also for education and health care for all, and even for social justice. I do not see a Delhi-type debacle happening in West Bengal."" ""So yes, we have to watch out. But think dialectically. With greater focus on non-corrupt, honest governance, and a secular, justice-oriented and tolerant society, I don't think Bengal is in great danger of falling into a sectarian trap,"" the economist said. The 91-year-old intellectual said that he dreamt of a united India moving faster and the lives of people becoming better. ""I would like to see India in which everyone is educated and has good, solid, reliable health care. I would like all to have a vision of a united India and ultimately a united world. ""We have a long way to go for that, but we have to bear these visions in mind. Yes, these include a lot of unfulfilled desires. I wouldn't say dreams, because these are all achievable things if we follow good, tolerant, cooperative politics and base our policies on them.""
