Chirag Paswan's Bihar bid: Pressure tactic on BJP or strategy to replace Nitish?,https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/assembly/story/chirag-paswan-bihar-assembly-election-pressure-tactic-on-bjp-or-strategy-to-replace-nitish-kumar-2734446-2025-06-02,"The Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) advocating for its party chief, Chirag Paswan, to contest the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar and that too, from a general seat, has triggered speculation about whether the 42-year-old Union Minister is set to throw his hat into the ring for the chief minister's post. On Sunday, Paswan's brother-in-law and MP Arun Bharti created a flutter with a series of social media posts, saying party workers wanted the minister to contest the state election not from a reserved seat but a general seat in order to send a strong message that he was not just a leader of the Dalit community but was now ready to lead the state. Interestingly, the entire buzz started when Paswan, currently Union Minister for Food Processing Industries, expressed his desire to return to Bihar to focus on state politics instead of staying in Delhi. Speaking about the buzz, the Union Minister said, “I have said this previously, that I don’t see myself in National politics for long. The only reason I came into politics was Bihar and Biharis. My vision has always been ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’, and I always want Bihar to prosper and be at par with other developed states."" He added, ""And I realised after becoming an MP for the third time that this would not be possible in Delhi. I had expressed my wish before the party that I want to return to Bihar soon.""CHIRAG IN RACE FOR CM? Chirag Paswan is a three-time Member of Parliament and currently a Union Minister in the Modi government. He was elected MP from Jamui (SC) in 2014 and 2019, and from Hajipur (SC) in 2024. Despite being inducted into the Union Cabinet in 2024 for the first time, Paswan has shown reluctance to continue at the Centre and is now keen on making a return to state politics. His party pushing the narrative that he should contest the assembly elections and lead the state strongly indicates he is eyeing the Chief Minister’s post. It’s worth noting that the NDA has already declared that the upcoming Bihar elections will be fought under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, despite his waning popularity and reports of his deteriorating health. Paswan, if sources are to be believed, is looking to capitalise on the present political vacuum. The Union Minister, however, was categorically said that Nitish Kumar will not be replaced. ""There is no vacancy for the chief minister post in Bihar. Nitish Kumar will become the CM after the elections,"" he said.PRESSURE TACTICS ON BJP? The other theory in the political circles of Bihar regarding Chirag's return to state politics is that he is trying to build pressure on the BJP for a seat-sharing agreement in the NDA. Chirag showcased his political strength during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections when his party, with the 100% strike rate, won all the five seats it contested. In the last couple of years, Chirag has been continuously doing public meetings across the state with his ""Bihar First, Bihari First"" agenda and drawing a huge response from the public. This clearly went on to show that Chirag was the tallest Dalit face in the state presently and had a solid vote base of at least 6% in the Dalit community, especially the Paswan community. Perhaps, this is one of the main reasons behind Chirag's uncompromising view on the seat-sharing agreement, where it wants the bigger share of the pie. LJP(R) building pressure on the BJP may not augur well for the NDA as the saffron party has already declared Nitish Kumar as the CM face and Chirag's fresh political manoeuvering could pose a serious challenge ahead of it to keep the NDA intact without upsetting anyone. Remember, the seat-sharing formula in the NDA for the Bihar elections has still not been finalised. However, continuous discussions within the alliance partners are going on.CHIRAG AS NITISH'S REPLACEMENT? Another narrative that is a point of discussion in Bihar politics is whether BJP is trying to position Chirag as an alternative to Nitish Kumar if NDA wins the elections. Keeping in mind Nitish Kumar's deteriorating health, popularity and influence, was the BJP looking for an alternative to Nitish Kumar? In the 2020 assembly elections, LJP(R) walked out of the NDA after Chirag's party failed to get the desired number of seats in the seat-sharing agreement and contested elections on its own, fielding more than 130 candidates, all against JDU, leading to a terrible performance by Nitish Kumar's party where it was pushed to third spot with just 43 seats. It was alleged then that it was the BJP's brain child behind Chirag walking out of NDA and fielding candidates against JDU to damage the party in which it was successful. It was after the 2020 assembly elections that a role reversal took place and the BJP emerged as a bigger partner in the NDA. If the NDA wins and Nitish becomes CM again, but is unable to perform due to health concerns, Chirag could step in as a ready and acceptable replacement.Published By:Priya PareekPublished On:Jun 2, 2025","The Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) advocating for its party chief, Chirag Paswan, to contest the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar.
